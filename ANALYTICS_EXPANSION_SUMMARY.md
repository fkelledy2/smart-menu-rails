#### **Data Collected:**
- User type (authenticated vs anonymous)
- Email domain analysis
- Message length statistics
- Form validation errors
- Referrer tracking

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Enhanced AnalyticsService Integration**
All controllers now use the centralized `AnalyticsService` instead of direct `Analytics.track` calls, providing:
- **Consistent event naming** via constants
- **Automatic error handling** and graceful degradation
- **User context enrichment** with additional metadata
- **Anonymous session tracking** with persistent session IDs

### **Automatic Page View Tracking**
Through the `AnalyticsTrackable` concern included in `ApplicationController`:
- **All controller actions** automatically tracked
- **User context** included (restaurant, locale, IP, user agent)
- **Anonymous users** supported with session-based tracking
- **Configurable per controller** with override options

### **Rich Data Collection**
Each event includes comprehensive metadata:
- **Business context** (restaurant IDs, plan information)
- **User behavior** (referrers, UTM parameters, session data)
- **Technical context** (user agents, IP addresses, locales)
- **Performance data** (timestamps, response times)
