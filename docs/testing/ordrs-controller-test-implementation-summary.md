## 🔍 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Test Structure**
```ruby
class OrdrsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  setup do
    sign_in users(:one)
    @ordr = ordrs(:one)
    @restaurant = restaurants(:one)
    @user = users(:one)
    @tablesetting = tablesettings(:one)
    @menu = menus(:one)
  end
  
  # 35 comprehensive test methods covering all aspects
end
```

### **Key Testing Patterns**
