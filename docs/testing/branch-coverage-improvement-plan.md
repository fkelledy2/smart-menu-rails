# Branch Coverage Improvement Plan
## Smart Menu Rails Application

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: October 11, 2025  
**Target**: Improve branch coverage from 35.26% to 90%+  
**Priority**: High - Foundation Completion Phase

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

- ✅ **Maintain line coverage ≥ 39.4%** (current: 3,925/9,963 lines)
- ✅ **Zero test failures** throughout implementation
- ✅ **Comprehensive conditional logic testing** across all critical paths

---

## 📊 **Current State Analysis**

### **Coverage Metrics**
- **Line Coverage**: 39.4% (3,925/9,963 lines) ✅ Good
- **Branch Coverage**: 35.26% (665/1,886 branches) ❌ Needs improvement
- **Total Tests**: 1,780 tests with 3,910 assertions ✅ Solid foundation

## 🔍 **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Identification & Analysis (Week 1)**
**Goal**: Identify high-impact conditional logic requiring branch coverage

#### **1.1 Conditional Logic Audit**
```bash
# Identify files with high conditional complexity
find app/ -name "*.rb" -exec grep -l "if\|unless\|case\|when\|&&\|||" {} \; | head -20

# Focus areas (prioritized by business impact):
# 1. Controllers - User-facing conditional logic
# 2. Models - Business rule validation and state management  
# 3. Services - Complex business logic processing
# 4. Policies - Authorization conditional paths
# 5. Helpers - View logic conditionals
```

#### **1.2 Branch Coverage Analysis Tools**
```ruby
# Use SimpleCov branch analysis
# Generate detailed branch coverage report
# Identify specific uncovered conditional paths
# Prioritize by file size and business criticality
```

### **Phase 2: High-Impact Controllers (Week 1-2)**
**Target**: Cover conditional logic in user-facing controllers

#### **2.1 Authentication & Authorization Branches**
```ruby
# Focus areas:
# - before_action conditionals
# - authorize conditionals  
# - current_user presence checks
# - role-based access control paths
# - session management conditionals

# Example patterns to test:
def show
  if current_user&.admin?
    # Admin path
  elsif current_user&.employee?
    # Employee path  
  else
    # Customer path
  end
end
```

#### **2.2 Request Format Conditionals**
```ruby
# Test all response format branches:
respond_to do |format|
  format.html { # HTML branch }
  format.json { # JSON branch }
  format.xml { # XML branch }
end

# Parameter validation branches:
if params[:id].present?
  # Present path
else
  # Missing path
end
```

#### **2.3 Error Handling Branches**
```ruby
# Exception handling paths:
begin
  # Happy path
rescue StandardError => e
  # Error path
ensure
  # Cleanup path
end

# Validation failure branches:
if @record.save
  # Success path
else
  # Failure path
end
```

### **Phase 3: Business Logic Models (Week 2-3)**
**Target**: Cover state management and validation conditionals

#### **3.1 Model Validation Branches**
```ruby
# Test all validation conditional paths:
validates :email, presence: true, if: :email_required?
validates :phone, presence: true, unless: :email_provided?

# State machine branches:
def can_transition_to?(state)
  case current_state
  when :pending
    [:active, :cancelled].include?(state)
  when :active  
    [:completed, :cancelled].include?(state)
  else
    false
  end
end
```

#### **3.2 Business Rule Conditionals**
```ruby
# Complex business logic branches:
def calculate_discount
  if premium_customer?
    if order_total > 100
      0.15 # 15% discount
    else
      0.10 # 10% discount
    end
  elsif repeat_customer?
    0.05 # 5% discount
  else
    0.0 # No discount
  end
end
```

### **Phase 4: Service Classes (Week 3-4)**
**Target**: Cover complex processing logic conditionals

#### **4.1 External API Integration Branches**
```ruby
# API response handling:
case response.status
when 200..299
  # Success path
when 400..499
  # Client error path
when 500..599
  # Server error path
else
  # Unexpected status path
end
```

#### **4.2 Data Processing Conditionals**
```ruby
# Complex data transformation branches:
def process_menu_data(data)
  return nil if data.blank?
  
  if data.is_a?(Hash)
    # Hash processing path
  elsif data.is_a?(Array)
    # Array processing path
  else
    # Other type path
  end
end
```

### **Phase 5: Policy & Helper Classes (Week 4)**
**Target**: Cover authorization and view logic conditionals

#### **5.1 Pundit Policy Branches**
```ruby
# Authorization conditional paths:
def update?
  return false unless user.present?
  
  if user.admin?
    true
  elsif user.employee? && record.restaurant == user.restaurant
    true
  else
    false
  end
end
```

#### **5.2 Helper Method Conditionals**
```ruby
# View logic branches:
def display_price(item)
  if current_user&.employee?
    "#{item.cost_price} (Cost: #{item.wholesale_price})"
  else
    item.display_price
  end
end
```

## 🧪 **Testing Methodology**

### **Branch Coverage Testing Patterns**

#### **1. Conditional Logic Testing**
```ruby
# Test all branches of conditional statements
test "should handle admin user access" do
  user = create(:user, :admin)
  sign_in user
  
  get :show, params: { id: @record.id }
  
  assert_response :success
  assert_select '.admin-controls' # Admin-specific content
end

test "should handle employee user access" do
  user = create(:user, :employee)
  sign_in user
  
  get :show, params: { id: @record.id }
  
  assert_response :success
  assert_select '.employee-controls' # Employee-specific content
end

test "should handle customer user access" do
  user = create(:user, :customer)
  sign_in user
  
  get :show, params: { id: @record.id }
  
  assert_response :success
  refute_select '.admin-controls' # No admin content
end
```

#### **2. Exception Path Testing**
```ruby
# Test error handling branches
test "should handle service unavailable gracefully" do
  ExternalService.stub(:call, -> { raise StandardError, "Service down" }) do
    post :create, params: { record: valid_params }
    
    assert_response :service_unavailable
    assert_match /temporarily unavailable/, flash[:error]
  end
end
```

#### **3. State Machine Testing**
```ruby
# Test all state transitions
test "should transition from pending to active" do
  record = create(:record, status: :pending)
  
  assert record.can_transition_to?(:active)
  assert record.activate!
  assert_equal :active, record.status
end

test "should not transition from completed to pending" do
  record = create(:record, status: :completed)
  
  refute record.can_transition_to?(:pending)
  assert_raises(StateMachineError) { record.pend! }
end
```

### **Coverage Verification Tools**

#### **1. SimpleCov Branch Analysis**
```ruby
# .simplecov configuration enhancement
SimpleCov.start 'rails' do
  enable_coverage :branch
  
  # Branch coverage thresholds
  minimum_coverage_by_file 80
  minimum_coverage 90
  
  # Detailed branch reporting
  formatter SimpleCov::Formatter::MultiFormatter.new([
    SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
    SimpleCov::Formatter::JSONFormatter
  ])
end
```

#### **2. Coverage Enforcement**
```ruby
# Rake task for branch coverage validation
namespace :test do
  desc "Validate branch coverage meets minimum threshold"
  task :branch_coverage do
    require 'simplecov'
    
    result = SimpleCov.result
    branch_coverage = result.branch_coverage
    
    if branch_coverage < 90.0
      puts "❌ Branch coverage #{branch_coverage}% below 90% threshold"
      exit 1
    else
      puts "✅ Branch coverage #{branch_coverage}% meets threshold"
    end
  end
end
```
