# bunq.com Homepage Analysis (Marketing + Design)

## Scope & caveats
This analysis is based on bunq’s public homepage content at `https://www.bunq.com/en-ie/` (copy/structure extracted) and typical contemporary bunq marketing patterns (hero-led conversion, feature storytelling, trust + pricing + FAQ). It is intended to inform a refreshed look-and-feel for the `mellow.menu` homepage.

## What bunq’s homepage is doing well

## Information architecture (section flow)
- **Hero**
  - Primary positioning: **“bank of The Free”**
  - Primary promise: **“Mobile banking that makes life easy”**
  - Primary conversion hook: **“Sign up in just 5 minutes with only your phone and ID.”**
  - Primary CTA: **Open a Bank Account**
- **High-level value proposition (overview)**
  - **“All you need from an online bank, in 1 app”** with short bullet-like statements.
- **How it works**
  - Clear step-by-step onboarding sequence (**join 20 million**, “Sign up in 5 minutes”, download app → details → ID verification).
- **Feature storytelling blocks** (repeatable pattern)

  - “Trusted by millions of users” + credibility bullets:
    - “Insured up to €100,000”
    - “Card Payment Refunds”
    - “Instant Payments”
    - “24/7 support”
- **Pricing / plans**
  - “Try it free for 30 days, no strings attached”
  - Plan cards: Free / €3.99 / €9.99 / €18.99 with one-line positioning per plan.
  - Links to full comparison + pricing sheet.
- **FAQ**
  - Objections handled late (what it is, independence, security, best plan).
- **Closing CTA**
  - Repeats the core conversion proposition: **“Open your Bank Account in 5 minutes”**.

## Messaging patterns that drive conversion
- **[Speed + simplicity]** “in 5 minutes”, “just your phone and ID”, “tap”.
- **[One container for everything]** “All you need … in 1 app”.
- **[Self-serve empowerment]** “Control everything yourself”.
- **[Proof via magnitude]** “Join 20 million users”.
- **[Trust anchors]** explicit safety/insurance/support bullets.
- **[Feature deep-links]** each feature is a doorway to deeper content, without forcing it.
- **[Clear segmentation]** Personal vs Business.

## Design / UX patterns (transferable)
Even without specific CSS screenshots, the content implies a familiar high-performing marketing system:
- **Hero-first, CTA-above-the-fold** with one dominant action.
- **Repeatable feature blocks** (headline + short paragraph + CTA link) that can stack or become alternating layouts.
- **Trust band** (logos, safety statements, hard guarantees).
- **Pricing cards** (simple at-a-glance tiers).
- **FAQ** to reduce anxiety and prevent bounce.
- **Repetition of the CTA** (hero and bottom).

## Key takeaways for mellow.menu
bunq is successful because it:
- Makes the product feel **immediately usable** (time-to-value is explicit).
- Presents a **clean, repeatable narrative structure** (feature blocks are consistent).
- Mixes **emotion (“bank of the free”)** with **specific, believable claims**.
- Reinforces trust and reduces friction before asking for commitment.

# Recommendations: a bunq-inspired look & feel for mellow.menu

## Goals for the mellow.menu homepage
- **Reduce time-to-understanding**: “What is mellow.menu?” in one sentence.
- **Increase time-to-belief**: clear proof + examples + credible claims.
- **Increase time-to-action**: CTA for “Create your menu” / “Try a demo” / “Book a call”.

## Positioning & hero (bunq pattern applied)
### Hero headline options (pick one direction)
- **Option A (speed-first)**
  - H1: “A beautiful digital menu in minutes.”
  - Sub: “Create a QR menu guests love. Update items instantly. Optional ordering, translations, and AI-enhanced images.”
  - CTA1: “Create my menu”
  - CTA2: “View demo menu”
- **Option B (guest experience-first)**
  - H1: “Menus that feel premium on every phone.”
  - Sub: “Fast-loading, accessible, multilingual menus with rich images—built for restaurants that care about the details.”
  - CTA1: “See it in action”
  - CTA2: “Start free”
- **Option C (operations-first)**
  - H1: “Update your menu once. Everywhere.”
  - Sub: “Stop reprinting. Publish changes instantly, manage sections/items, and keep allergens & pricing consistent.”
  - CTA1: “Get started”
  - CTA2: “Talk to us”

### Hero composition
- **[Primary visual]** a realistic phone mock (or embedded interactive demo) showing:
  - menu sections
  - a menu item with image + allergens
  - language switcher
- **[Trust micro-band]** directly under hero:
  - “Used by restaurants” (logos if available)
  - “Fast setup” (e.g. “First menu in 10 minutes”)
  - “Guest-first UX” (e.g. “Loads instantly, no app required”)

## Homepage section sequence (bunq-style)
### 1) “All you need … in one place” overview
A short section that anchors the product footprint.
- **Headline**: “Everything your menu needs—without the clutter.”
- **Bullets** (tight, bunq-like):
  - “Instant updates (no reprints)”
  - “Allergens and dietary labels”
  - “Multilingual menus”
  - “Images that actually match the dish”
  - “Optional ordering + bill request”

### 2) “How it works” (3-step)
Mirror bunq’s onboarding clarity.
- “Create your menu” → “Add items / upload existing menu” → “Print QR & share”

### 3) Feature blocks (repeatable pattern)
Use bunq’s consistent storytelling blocks. Suggested set:
- **“Tap to explore the menu”** (guest UX, speed, accessibility)
- **“Edit once, publish instantly”** (ops)
- **“Allergens done properly”** (trust + compliance)
- **“Multilingual by default”** (tourist-friendly)
- **“Photos that sell the dish”** (AI images / human images)

Each block should have:
- **headline**
- **2–4 lines of copy**
- **one secondary link** (“Learn more”) that goes to a deeper page.

### 4) Trust & safety band
bunq uses explicit guarantees; mellow should do the same in its domain.
- “Fast on mobile” (performance)
- “Accessible” (WCAG-ish claims only if true)
- “Secure” (if payments/ordering)
- “Support” (response time / channels)

### 5) Pricing / plans
bunq’s pricing cards are effective because they have *one-line personas*.
Suggested tiers (example framing):
- **Starter**: “For small cafés getting online.”
- **Pro**: “For restaurants that update often.”
- **Multi-site**: “For groups & hotels.”

Include:
- “Compare plans”
- “What’s included”
- “No lock-in” / “cancel anytime” if true

### 6) FAQ
Handle objections:
- “Do guests need an app?”
- “Can I edit from my phone?”
- “How do allergens work?”
- “Can we do multiple languages?”
- “Can you import from PDF?”
- “What if we already have photos?”

### 7) Closing CTA
Repeat the core promise and action:
- “Launch your menu today.”
- CTA: “Create my menu” / “Book a demo”

## Visual system recommendations (bunq-inspired, adapted to mellow)
### Design principles
- **[Calm confidence]** mellow should feel “quietly premium”, not noisy.
- **[High contrast + generous whitespace]** for readability.
- **[Strong product imagery]** (phone mockups, real dish photos) as the hero.

### Color direction
- bunq’s brand is bold; mellow can be softer:
  - **Base**: near-white background + slate text
  - **Accent**: one strong brand color for CTAs (e.g. deep green, warm amber, or modern purple)
  - **Support**: subtle pastel surfaces for feature cards

### Typography
- Use a modern grotesk/sans (system or a webfont) with:
  - large H1 (tight, confident)
  - readable body copy (16–18px)
  - short lines (max-width) to avoid “wall of text”

### Components to standardize
- **Primary CTA button** (single dominant color)
- **Secondary CTA** (outline)
- **Feature card** (icon + headline + 2 lines)
- **Plan cards** (tier name + price + 3 bullets)
- **Trust band** (icon bullets, small)

### Motion
- Subtle section reveals and hover states (no gimmicks).
- If you use Lottie/video, keep it short and optional.

## Concrete homepage wire outline (copy-first)
- Nav: Product / Pricing / Case studies / Help / Login
- Hero: H1 + sub + CTA + demo + phone mock
- Proof strip: logos + “X menus created” (if you have metrics)
- Overview: “Everything you need…” bullets
- How it works: 3 steps
- Features: 5 blocks
- Trust: “Built for restaurants” credibility bullets
- Pricing: 3–4 tiers
- FAQ
- Footer CTA

## What to avoid (bunq also avoids this)
- **Overly long paragraphs** (keep copy scannable)
- **Too many CTAs** above the fold
- **Feature dumps without outcomes** (always answer “so what?”)

---

## Next steps
- Decide which hero positioning direction to commit to (speed vs guest UX vs operations).
- Identify 3–5 “proof assets” we can show on the homepage (demo menu, screenshots, metrics, testimonials).
- If you share the current `mellow.menu` homepage URL or current hero copy, I can propose a direct rewrite and a section-by-section replacement plan.

# mellow.menu: Current Homepage Notes + Hero A (Speed-first)

## Current homepage (https://www.mellow.menu/) quick audit
### What’s already working
- Clear product category: digital menus + ordering.
- Strong feature set is visible above the fold (Translate, AI images, inventory, analytics, ordering).
- Demo menu browse link is present.
- Pricing tiers are easy to scan.

### What’s holding conversion back
- The hero is broad (“Add intelligence to your restaurant”) and doesn’t state **time-to-value**.
- Only one CTA (“Sign up”) is presented; there’s no lower-friction “See demo” style path.
- “Testimonials” currently look like placeholder text, which can reduce trust.
- “Numbers” section is present but lacks visible values in the extracted content; if it’s empty or low-signal it won’t help belief.

## Hero Option A (recommended initial hero)
Goal: be explicit about speed and outcome, like bunq’s “in 5 minutes” framing.

### Copy (paste-ready)
- **H1**: “A beautiful digital menu in minutes.”
- **Subheadline**: “Create a QR menu guests love. Update items instantly. Add translations, ordering, and AI dish images when you’re ready.”
- **Primary CTA**: “Create my menu” (links to Sign up)
- **Secondary CTA**: “View demo menu” (links to /smartmenus)

### Trust micro-band (under CTAs)
Keep this to 3 short proof points.
- “No app needed for guests”
- “Multilingual menus”
- “Instant updates (no reprints)”

If you have real metrics/logos, swap one of the above for:
- “Trusted by X restaurants” or “X menus published”

### Hero visual (right side)
Pick one:
- **Interactive demo embed** (preferred): render a smartmenu preview in a phone frame (real product).
- **Static phone mock**: screenshot showing:
  - section list
  - one dish with image + allergens
  - language switcher

### Layout notes
- Two-column hero on desktop (copy left, visual right); stacked on mobile.
- Keep hero height compact enough that **Features** header is visible on most laptops (reduces bounce).
- CTA buttons should be visually distinct (primary filled, secondary outline).

## A/B testing plan (reserve Hero B & C for later)

### Variants
- **Variant A (speed-first)**: the copy above.
- **Variant B (guest experience-first)**: “Menus that feel premium on every phone.”
- **Variant C (operations-first)**: “Update your menu once. Everywhere.”

### What stays constant across variants
To avoid confounding:
- same page structure below hero (Features → Demo → Numbers → Pricing)
- same CTA destinations (`/users/sign_up`, `/smartmenus`)
- same hero visual (or rotate only after you’ve proven copy impact)

### Success metrics (choose 1 primary)
- **Primary**: click-through rate on primary CTA (Sign up).
- **Secondary**:
  - click-through rate on “View demo menu”
  - sign-up completion rate (if tracked)
  - time-to-first-demo interaction

### Implementation approach (lightweight)
- Add a `hero_variant` value (e.g. `A`, `B`, `C`) determined by:
  - query param override (`?hero=A`) for QA
  - otherwise a stable assignment (cookie/localStorage) for a visitor
- Emit events:
  - `hero_view` with variant
  - `hero_primary_cta_click` with variant
  - `hero_secondary_cta_click` with variant

### Rollout suggestion
- Start with **A as default**.
- When ready, run 50/50 A vs B until you have a clear CTR winner.
- Then test the winner vs C.
