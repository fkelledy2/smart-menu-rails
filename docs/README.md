## 🔍 Finding Documentation

Use the directory structure above to locate relevant documentation. Each category contains focused documentation for that domain.

For historical reference, check the `legacy/` directory for archived documentation that may still contain useful context.

## 📝 Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:
1. Choose the appropriate category directory
2. Use descriptive filenames with consistent naming conventions
3. Update this README with links to new important documents
4. Follow the established markdown formatting standards

## 🏷️ Document Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `database-optimization.md`
- Include version/phase when relevant: `optimization-phase-2.md`
- Use descriptive names: `javascript-module-architecture.md`
- Avoid abbreviations: `performance-analysis.md` not `perf-analysis.md`
