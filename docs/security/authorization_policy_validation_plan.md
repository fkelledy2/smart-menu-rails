# Authorization Policy Validation Plan

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to validate authorization policies across all user roles in the Smart Menu Rails application. The goal is to ensure that every user role has appropriate access controls and that authorization policies are consistently enforced across all complex controllers.

**Current Status**: Authorization policies exist but lack comprehensive validation across all user roles and edge cases.

**Target**: 100% authorization policy validation coverage with automated testing for all user roles and permission scenarios.

---

## üìä **Current Authorization Architecture Analysis**

### **User Roles Identified**

1. **Restaurant Owners** (`user.restaurants.any?`)
   - Primary role for restaurant management
   - Full access to their own restaurant data
   - Cannot access other restaurants' data

2. **Employees** (`Employee` model with roles)
   - **Staff** (`role: :staff`) - Basic operational access
   - **Manager** (`role: :manager`) - Enhanced operational access
   - **Admin** (`role: :admin`) - Administrative access within restaurant

3. **Customers/Anonymous Users**
   - Can view public menus
   - Limited to read-only operations on public data
   - No access to management interfaces

4. **System Administrators**
   - Access to admin controllers (`Admin::*`)
   - System-wide monitoring and management capabilities

### **Current Policy Structure**

```ruby
# Base Policy Pattern
class ApplicationPolicy
  def initialize(user, record)
    @user = user || User.new # Guest user
    @record = record
  end
  
  # Default deny-all approach
  def index?; false; end
  def show?; false; end
  def create?; false; end
  def update?; false; end
  def destroy?; false; end
end
```

### **Key Policies Analyzed**

1. **RestaurantPolicy** - Owner-based access control
2. **MenuPolicy** - Mixed public/owner access
3. **EmployeePolicy** - Restaurant owner control
4. **OrdrPolicy** - Complex multi-user access
5. **Admin Policies** - System administrator access

---

## üîç **Authorization Gaps Identified**

### **1. Employee Role-Based Access Control**
- **Gap**: Employee roles (staff/manager/admin) not consistently enforced
- **Risk**: Employees may have inappropriate access levels
- **Impact**: Medium - Potential privilege escalation within restaurants

### **2. Cross-Restaurant Data Leakage**
- **Gap**: Insufficient validation of restaurant ownership in complex queries
- **Risk**: Users accessing other restaurants' data
- **Impact**: High - Data privacy violation

### **3. Anonymous User Access Control**
- **Gap**: Inconsistent handling of anonymous users across controllers
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Impact**: Medium - Information disclosure

### **4. API Endpoint Authorization**
- **Gap**: JSON API endpoints may have different authorization rules
- **Risk**: API bypass of web interface restrictions
- **Impact**: High - Complete authorization bypass

### **5. Nested Resource Authorization**
- **Gap**: Complex nested resources (restaurant/menu/items) may not validate full chain
- **Risk**: Access to resources through unauthorized parent resources
- **Impact**: Medium - Indirect access to restricted data

## üìã **Detailed Implementation Tasks**

### **Task 1: Policy Enhancement**

#### **1.1 Employee Role-Based Policies**
```ruby
# Enhanced policy with employee role support
class MenuPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def update?
    owner? || authorized_employee?
  end
  
  private
  
  def authorized_employee?
    return false unless user.present?
    
    employee = user.employees.joins(:restaurant)
                   .find_by(restaurants: { id: record.restaurant_id })
    
    employee&.manager? || employee&.admin?
  end
end
```

#### **1.2 Cross-Restaurant Validation**
```ruby
# Strengthen restaurant ownership validation
class RestaurantPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def show?
    owner? || authorized_employee?
  end
  
  private
  
  def owner?
    return false unless user && record
    record.user_id == user.id
  end
  
  def authorized_employee?
    return false unless user.present?
    user.employees.exists?(restaurant_id: record.id)
  end
end
```

### **Task 2: Comprehensive Test Suite**

#### **2.1 Role-Based Test Framework**
```ruby
# Authorization test helper
module AuthorizationTestHelper
  def test_authorization_for_all_roles(action, resource)
    roles = [:owner, :employee_admin, :employee_manager, :employee_staff, :customer, :anonymous]
    
    roles.each do |role|
      user = create_user_with_role(role)
      result = policy_for(user, resource).public_send("#{action}?")
      
      assert_equal expected_result(role, action), result,
        "#{role} should #{expected_result(role, action) ? 'be allowed' : 'be denied'} #{action}"
    end
  end
end
```

#### **2.2 Cross-Restaurant Isolation Tests**
```ruby
# Test cross-restaurant data isolation
class CrossRestaurantAuthorizationTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "restaurant owner cannot access other restaurant data" do
    owner1 = users(:restaurant_owner_1)
    owner2 = users(:restaurant_owner_2)
    restaurant2 = restaurants(:restaurant_2)
    
    policy = RestaurantPolicy.new(owner1, restaurant2)
    
    refute policy.show?, "Owner should not access other restaurant"
    refute policy.update?, "Owner should not update other restaurant"
    refute policy.destroy?, "Owner should not delete other restaurant"
  end
end
```

### **Task 3: Authorization Monitoring**

#### **3.1 Authorization Failure Logging**
```ruby
# Enhanced application controller with authorization logging
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  rescue_from Pundit::NotAuthorizedError do |exception|
    # Log authorization failure for monitoring
    Rails.logger.warn "Authorization failed: #{exception.message}", {
      user_id: current_user&.id,
      controller: controller_name,
      action: action_name,
      resource: exception.record&.class&.name,
      resource_id: exception.record&.id
    }
    
    redirect_to root_path, alert: 'You are not authorized to perform this action.'
  end
end
```

#### **3.2 Authorization Metrics**
```ruby
# Authorization metrics tracking
class AuthorizationMetrics
  def self.track_authorization_check(user, resource, action, result)
    Rails.logger.info "Authorization check", {
      user_id: user&.id,
      user_role: determine_user_role(user),
      resource_type: resource.class.name,
      action: action,
      result: result,
      timestamp: Time.current
    }
  end
end
```
