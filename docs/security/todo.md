# Security TODO

## 🎯 **Remaining Tasks - Security & Authorization**

Based on analysis of security documentation, here are the critical security tasks that need immediate attention:

### **🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY - Security Vulnerabilities**

#### **1. Fix Conditional Authorization Bypass (HIGH SEVERITY)**
- [ ] **MenusController#show** - Line 73: Replace `authorize @menu if current_user` with proper authorization
- [ ] **MenuparticipantsController** - Lines 22, 32, 37, 43, 59: Fix conditional authorization
- [ ] **OrdritemsController** - Lines 18, 24, 29, 35, 65, 89: Implement consistent authorization
- [ ] **OrdrsController** - Lines 70, 154, 177, 225: Remove conditional authorization patterns

**Security Risk**: Anonymous users can access sensitive business data without authorization
**Impact**: Unauthorized access to orders, menu data, and business information

#### **2. Standardize Authorization Patterns (MEDIUM SEVERITY)**
- [ ] **Audit all controllers** for mixed authorization patterns
- [ ] **Replace conditional authorization** (`authorize @record if current_user`) with consistent patterns
- [ ] **Implement proper public/private separation** for customer vs. owner access
- [ ] **Create authorization policy documentation** for consistent implementation

#### **3. Public vs Private Controller Security (MEDIUM SEVERITY)**
- [ ] **Menu viewing security** - Separate public customer access from private owner management
- [ ] **Order management security** - Distinguish customer order access from staff management
- [ ] **Menu participants security** - Secure customer-facing features with business data protection

### **HIGH PRIORITY - Security Hardening**

#### **4. Authentication & Session Security**
- [ ] **Session timeout implementation** for inactive users
- [ ] **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for admin accounts
- [ ] **Password policy enforcement** (complexity, rotation)
- [ ] **Account lockout protection** against brute force attacks

#### **5. API Security Enhancement**
- [ ] **API rate limiting** implementation to prevent abuse
- [ ] **API authentication tokens** with proper expiration
- [ ] **API input validation** and sanitization
- [ ] **API audit logging** for security monitoring

#### **6. Data Protection & Privacy**
- [ ] **Data encryption at rest** for sensitive information
- [ ] **PII (Personally Identifiable Information) protection** measures
- [ ] **GDPR compliance** implementation and validation
- [ ] **Data retention policies** and automated cleanup

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Security Monitoring**

#### **7. Security Monitoring & Alerting**
- [ ] **Failed login attempt monitoring** and alerting
- [ ] **Suspicious activity detection** (unusual access patterns)
- [ ] **Security incident response** procedures and automation
- [ ] **Regular security audit** scheduling and tracking

#### **8. Vulnerability Management**
- [ ] **Automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] **Dependency vulnerability monitoring** (Bundler Audit automation)
- [ ] **Regular penetration testing** scheduling
- [ ] **Security patch management** process and automation

#### **9. Access Control & Permissions**
- [ ] **Role-based access control (RBAC)** enhancement
- [ ] **Principle of least privilege** enforcement
- [ ] **Access review processes** for user permissions
- [ ] **Administrative access monitoring** and logging

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Compliance & Governance**

#### **10. Compliance Framework**
- [ ] **GDPR compliance audit** and gap analysis
- [ ] **PCI DSS compliance** for payment processing (if applicable)
- [ ] **SOC 2 compliance** preparation for enterprise customers
- [ ] **Security policy documentation** and training

#### **11. Security Documentation**
- [ ] **Security incident response plan** documentation
- [ ] **Security architecture documentation** updates
- [ ] **Security training materials** for development team
- [ ] **Security best practices guide** for ongoing development

#### **12. Third-party Security**
- [ ] **Vendor security assessment** for all integrations
- [ ] **Third-party service security** monitoring
- [ ] **API integration security** validation
- [ ] **Cloud service security** configuration review

## 🚨 **Immediate Action Required**

### **Critical Security Fixes (This Week)**
1. **Audit and fix all conditional authorization** - `authorize @record if current_user`
2. **Implement consistent authorization patterns** across all controllers
3. **Test authorization bypass scenarios** to validate fixes
4. **Document secure authorization patterns** for future development

### **Security Testing (Next Week)**
1. **Penetration testing** of authorization fixes
2. **Security regression testing** in CI/CD
3. **Authorization policy validation** across all user roles
4. **Security audit of API endpoints**

## 📊 **Security Metrics & Targets**

### **Authorization Security**
- [ ] **100% consistent authorization** - No conditional authorization patterns
- [ ] **Zero unauthorized access** - All endpoints properly protected
- [ ] **Complete policy coverage** - All resources have proper Pundit policies
- [ ] **Automated authorization testing** - Security tests in CI/CD

### **Security Monitoring**
- [ ] **Real-time security alerting** - Immediate notification of security events
- [ ] **Security incident response** - <15 minute response time to critical issues
- [ ] **Vulnerability remediation** - <24 hour fix time for critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Security audit compliance** - 100% compliance with security standards

### **Data Protection**
